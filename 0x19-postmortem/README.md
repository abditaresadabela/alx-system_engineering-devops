Issue Summary:
Duration: May 10, 2023, 2:00 PM to May 11, 2023, 10:00 AM (PDT)
Impact: Users were unable to access the login page, resulting in a 75% decrease in user activity on the platform.

Root Cause: An issue with the database connection pool caused a backlog of requests, leading to a high number of timeouts and an unresponsive server.

Timeline:
- May 10, 2023, 2:00 PM: The issue was first detected when monitoring tools reported an increase in request timeouts.
- May 10, 2023, 2:30 PM: The engineering team investigated the issue and initially suspected a network issue. They attempted to diagnose the issue by checking network configurations and restarting network devices.
- May 10, 2023, 4:00 PM: The team noticed that the issue was not resolved, and the problem persisted. They then suspected that the database may be the root cause and checked its configurations.
- May 10, 2023, 5:30 PM: After further investigation, the team found that there was a backlog of requests in the database connection pool, leading to a high number of timeouts and an unresponsive server.
- May 10, 2023, 6:00 PM: The engineering team escalated the incident to the database administration team.
- May 11, 2023, 10:00 AM: The incident was resolved, and the platform was back to normal operation.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was a backlog of requests in the database connection pool, causing the server to become unresponsive. This was due to a misconfiguration of the connection pool settings, which caused a limit to the number of available connections to the database.

To resolve the issue, the database administration team increased the number of available connections in the connection pool settings, ensuring that the server could handle the expected load without backlog.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent a similar issue from occurring in the future, the engineering team will implement the following corrective and preventative measures:
- Perform a regular review of database connection pool settings to ensure that they are optimized for expected usage.
- Increase monitoring of connection pool performance to detect issues earlier.
- Implement automatic scaling of the connection pool to adjust to changes in usage patterns.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
- Review connection pool settings and ensure that they are optimized for expected usage.
- Increase monitoring of connection pool performance and configure alerts to notify the team of any issues.
- Implement automatic scaling of the connection pool to adjust to changes in usage patterns.
- Perform a post-incident review to identify areas for improvement and update incident response procedures accordingly.
